# Stock_Price_pred_based_on_sentiments_-_Marketmoods
This project builds an end-to-end trading signal system for Reliance Industries Ltd. by combining:
<br>
📊 Historical stock price patterns (LSTM)
<br>
📰 Financial news sentiment (FinBERT + NewsAPI)
<br>
The goal is to generate a daily BUY / SELL / HOLD signal using both quantitative price action and qualitative market sentiment.
<br>
Financial markets are driven by price trends and news sentiment.
This project integrates both:
LSTM model learns temporal patterns from Reliance stock data
FinBERT extracts sentiment from financial news
A fusion rule combines both signals into a final trading decision

Each news article fetched from NewsAPI is processed individually. FinBERT classifies every article into one of three categories: negative, neutral, or positive. These labels are mapped to numerical values −1, 0, and +1 respectively.
<br>
For a given day, multiple news articles may exist. The sentiment scores of all articles published on that day are averaged, producing a single daily sentiment value. This daily sentiment captures the overall market tone for that date.

<br>

The final trading signal is generated by combining price prediction and news sentiment, rather than relying on either one alone. The LSTM model predicts the expected return for the next trading day based on recent price behavior. News sentiment is then used as a confirmation signal.
<br>
A BUY signal is generated when the LSTM predicts a positive return and the news sentiment is not strongly negative. A SELL signal is generated when the LSTM predicts a negative return and the news sentiment is strongly negative. In all other cases, the system outputs HOLD to avoid trading during uncertain or conflicting signals.
<br>


The LSTM model uses a set of technical indicators to capture price movement, trend, momentum, and volatility. Daily log returns, OHLC prices, and trading volume describe basic price behavior and market activity. RSI (14) and MACD capture momentum and trend direction, while 20-day volatility measures recent price uncertainty. These features together allow the model to learn meaningful patterns from historical stock data.
